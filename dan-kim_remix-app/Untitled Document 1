A disregard for animal suffering raises questions about an individual's empathy and moral standards, as it indicates a failure to recognize the sentience and capacity for pain that animals possess.
Here's a breakdown of the key ethical considerations:

    Pain and Suffering: Large bladder stones can cause chronic pain and irritation to the bladder lining, potentially leading to inflammation, infection, and damage to the urinary tract.
    Urinary Blockage: Untreated bladder stones can obstruct the flow of urine from the bladder, which is a painful and potentially fatal condition, especially in male dogs with their narrower urethras. This can lead to bladder rupture and the buildup of toxins in the bloodstream, according to VCA Animal Hospitals.
    Kidney Damage: The obstruction of urine flow due to bladder stones can put undue pressure on the kidneys, potentially leading to kidney damage and even kidney failure over time.
    Impact on Quality of Life: The pain and complications associated with bladder stones can significantly diminish a dog's quality of life. They may experience frequent urination, straining to urinate, bloody urine, abdominal pain, lethargy, and a decreased appetite, says Honest Paws.
    Availability of Treatment: Effective treatments for bladder stones in dogs exist, including surgical removal, urohydropropulsion, and in some cases, dietary dissolution. Ignoring these available treatments to alleviate suffering is generally viewed as ethically problematic.
